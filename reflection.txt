Reflection:

Challenges in this project were very similar to past projects,
with some roadblocks of depressingly long spans of time searching
 for the reason things weren't working online. I think I am slowly
  improving at sifting through python data and documentation to
   find what I need, but time will tell. I do like the end result
    of this project, the mini piano is a nice product.

    Specifically, the parts that took me the longest were:
     Figuring out I had commented out the line:
     self.addEventListeners()

     and
     Figuring out that if you don't specify a border size in
     Qt Designer, it prevents you from adding hover functionality
     to your buttons.
